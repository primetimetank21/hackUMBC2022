## Inspiration
Users of cryptocurrency are constantly targeted by various fraud and variousÂ threats on their holdings. Because of a lack of regulation and knowledge in the crypto space, attackers have been able to exploit protocols and users alike, resulting in over $10 billion in theft and scams in 2021 alone. Of these attacks, roughly $38 million was stolen from Alpha Homora V2, a yield farming protocol. One method of helping to protect companies and consumers, along with their assets is to instill trust in the parties with whom they are transacting with.
